# Workstation Agent Practice

This context names workstation-owned agent support concepts.

## Language

**Workstation configuration freshness**:
Owned by `workstation-setup`; canonical definition lives in homelab-iac's `CONTEXT.md`.
_Avoid_: Home Manager generation check, local freshness algorithm

**Workstation-local Moraine**:
The v1 Moraine deployment whose ingestion, persistence, and query backend all
run under the workstation user without depending on Overmind.
_Avoid_: Shared Moraine, Overmind Moraine

**Moraine central server**:
Moraine's per-user local Unix-socket backend within Workstation-local Moraine.
_Avoid_: Remote backend, central database

**Workstation applicability**:
The chezmoi `is_workstation` data value, true only when the hostname is
`workstation`; it gates fish exclusion, package installation, and agent-skill
reconciliation.
_Avoid_: is_lxc, LXC applicability, container flag
