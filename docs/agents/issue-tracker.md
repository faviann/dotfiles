# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as GitHub issues. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Use a heredoc for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, also fetching labels.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'` with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply or remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` or `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close an issue**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

Infer the repository from `git remote -v`; `gh` does this automatically when run inside this clone.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The map is a single issue with child issues as tickets.

- **Map**: an issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding Notes, Decisions-so-far, and Fog. Create it with `gh issue create --label wayfinder:map`.
- **Child ticket**: an issue linked to the map as a GitHub sub-issue. Where sub-issues are unavailable, add the child to a task list in the map body and put `Part of #<map>` at the top of the child body. Use a `wayfinder:<type>` label: `research`, `prototype`, `grilling`, or `task`.
- **Blocking**: use GitHub’s native issue dependencies. Where dependencies are unavailable, put `Blocked by: #<n>, #<n>` at the top of the child body.
- **Frontier query**: inspect the map’s open children, discard tickets with open blockers or an assignee, and select the first remaining ticket in map order.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-assignee @me`
- **Resolve**: comment with the answer, close the child issue, and append a context pointer to the map’s Decisions-so-far section.
