# Bootstrap - New Machine Setup

Run these steps in order on any new workstation.

## 1. Install chezmoi and Bitwarden CLI

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- -b ~/.local/bin
sudo snap install bw
```

## 2. Unlock Bitwarden

```bash
bw login                                  # first time only
export BW_SESSION=$(bw unlock --raw)
```

Do not paste or commit secrets. Keep the session token in your shell only.

## 3. Bootstrap over HTTPS

The first checkout uses HTTPS so a new machine does not need an SSH key before
chezmoi can render one from Bitwarden.

```bash
chezmoi init --apply https://github.com/faviann/dotfiles.git
```

After apply, chezmoi writes `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`, `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`, and
`~/.ssh/known_hosts`. Dotfiles pins GitHub's published Ed25519 SSH host key; it
does not scan the network during apply. A run-after script then switches the
chezmoi source repo origin to `git@github.com:faviann/dotfiles.git`.

## 4. Apply Home Manager on the Workstation LXC

The Ansible-managed `workstation` LXC installs Determinate Nix and a
`workstation-setup` helper. Run that helper after Bitwarden is unlocked:

```bash
workstation-setup
```

It runs `chezmoi init/update`, applies the `#workstation` Home Manager flake,
authenticates GitHub CLI from the `dotfiles/github-cli-token` Bitwarden item,
and validates the expected tools. Chezmoi installs AoE first. Home Manager then
installs the base tools, loads the user units, and hands off to
`update-agent-tools` if any managed agent command is missing. This installs the
[complete agent toolchain](README.md#workstation-home-manager) without another
package-discovery or Ansible step.

The bootstrap handoff is part of `workstation-setup`, not SSH login or a
background schedule. A fresh bootstrap has no ACP workers and needs no
disruption consent. If repairing missing tools with active workers cannot
prompt, run `update-agent-tools --yes` explicitly, then retry
`workstation-setup`; bootstrap never supplies restart consent on your behalf.

Chezmoi also recovers agent skills on the workstation. If `~/repos/skills` is
absent, it clones `faviann/skills`; it never updates an existing checkout. The
repository's reconciler restores supported harness links while leaving
deprecated skills unlinked. Skill reconciliation runs during `chezmoi apply`,
never during shell login.

Hermes runtime state lives in `~/.hermes`. On a rebuilt workstation that already
has Hermes state, move that directory into `/ephemeral/workstation/home/.hermes`
before enabling the bind mount. For Collie's service-regeneration prerequisites
and retry command, see [recovery after an LXC rebuild](docs/collie-pilot-runbook.md#recovery-after-an-lxc-rebuild).

## Bitwarden SSH Key Item

Create or maintain one Bitwarden item named:

```text
dotfiles/workstation-ssh-key
```

The item must contain:

- Notes: the private OpenSSH Ed25519 key for `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
- Custom field `public_key`: the matching public key for `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`

Keep the private key only in the item notes. Do not duplicate it into docs,
Ansible vars, shell history, or plaintext files. For later replacement, use the
[SSH key rotation procedure](README.md#ssh-key-rotation).

## GitHub Registration

Register the same public key in GitHub twice:

- Settings -> SSH and GPG keys -> New SSH key -> Authentication Key
- Settings -> SSH and GPG keys -> New SSH key -> Signing Key

This gives the workstation one stable SSH identity for both Git authentication
and commit signing.

## Lightweight Verification

Check that the rendered public key matches the private key without printing the
private key:

```bash
diff -u \
  <(awk 'NF >= 2 { print $1 " " $2; exit }' ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub) \
  <(ssh-keygen -y -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 | awk 'NF >= 2 { print $1 " " $2; exit }')
```

No output means the key pair matches.

Check GitHub SSH auth:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

GitHub should identify the account and report that shell access is not provided.

## Optional GitHub CLI Auth

If you use `gh`, authenticate without generating or uploading another SSH key:

```bash
gh auth login --git-protocol ssh --skip-ssh-key
```

## Day-to-Day Updates

After bootstrap, use `workstation-update` for routine maintenance. See the
canonical [workstation maintenance guidance](README.md#workstation-maintenance)
for source guards, Bitwarden sessions, restart consent, and failure recovery.

## Clone ServerManagementScripts

On the managed `workstation` LXC, run `workstation-setup` before this step so
Home Manager has installed `uv`. The vault passphrase is written by chezmoi
from Bitwarden before this step.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:faviann/ServerManagementScripts.git
cd ServerManagementScripts
./setup.sh
```

## Hostname Contract

The LXC workstation must be named `workstation` as set by the Ansible repo.
That hostname triggers `is_workstation = true` in `.chezmoi.toml.tmpl`, which
skips fish config on that machine.

When lifecycle playbooks run from the workstation itself, they exclude that host
by default. To manage it intentionally, run:

```bash
uv run --locked ansible-playbook site.yml -e proxmox_skip_self=false --limit workstation
```
